Hi, I’m Pooja Pathak! I’m researching the Racial Disparities in Criminal Charges, Convictions, and Sentencing within San Diego County under Dr. Jason Fleischer. As a Computer Science graduate student, I’m actively involved in projects involving Machine learning and teaching undergraduate programming classes. Asides, I’m an avid reader and dancer. You can reach me at [pmpathak@ucsd.edu](mailto:pmpathak@ucsd.edu).
