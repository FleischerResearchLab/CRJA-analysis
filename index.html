        <h1>Analysis of racial disparities in criminal charges, convictions, and sentencing within San Diego County</h1>

        <h2>About CRJA</h2>
        <p>
            California Governor Gavin Newsom signed several laws after taking office in 2019 to promote racial equality and justice. Among them, the California Racial Justice Act (AB 2542), proposed by Assemblyman Ash Kalra in the South Bay constituency, was also signed by Newsom in September 2020, which would prohibit the use of race or ethnicity to seek or obtain a conviction or sentence. This new law prohibits state prosecutors from racially discriminating against suspects, prosecutors are not allowed to prosecute suspects as long as they can prove that law enforcement officials discriminated against them; even if a suspect is convicted, a retrial is available.

        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <p>
            We are the first team that tries to find out what aspects of criminal justice data might be helpful to those citing the RJA. The goal of this research is to seek acceptable statistical methods for demonstrating racial disparities.
            CRJA motions can get the demographics before the court and the public to help influence the policymakers to end the criminalization of homeless people. In the meantime, we are seeking and disclosing more data on the racial composition of charges, convictions, and sentences in San Diego County and its municipalities through the submission of Public Records Act (PRA) and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, as well as data analyzed using the Pandas python library.
