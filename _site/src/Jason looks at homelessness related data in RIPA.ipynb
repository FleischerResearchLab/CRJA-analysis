    "## Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "Approved in 2020, the California Racial Justice Act allows defendants to appeal for a retrial of their case or an adjustment of the charges or sentencing leveled at them if they can prove that there was racial bias at play. The bill doesn’t actually specify the kind of statistical proof a judge would require, though, so this project is a preliminary search to start to find out what kinds of aspects of criminal justice data might be useful to those invoking the CRJA. To that end, this project used pandas to analyze a dataset of San Diego Police Department stop data collected under RIPA, the Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015. "

    "## Introduction <a id='introduction'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The California Racial Justice Act (AB-2542), approved by the governor in September 2020, is legislation that intends to combat racial bias and disparities in the criminal justice system by offering defendants a chance to contest their cases. The CRJA is usable on multiple levels — checking racial bias both in and out of courtrooms — as it addresses within-court instances of bias as well as racially charged disparities in sentencing, charges, and convictions. If the defendant invoking the CRJA can provide proof of discrimination occurring, a new trial will be set up for the case or the charges or sentence may be adjusted, depending on how far along the court case is. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s key legislation in that it not only takes into account intentional bias directed at the defendant (by any other key figure in the courtroom processes) but also racially coded language or interactions. The aspect of the CRJA that this project specifically has focused on is racial disparities in charges. The evidence needed for proof of discrimination in court (when it comes to racial bias in charges) is differences due to race, national origin, or ethnicity in charges on a county-wide basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was originally to synthesize a database of information (via extensive data collection, organization, and cleaning) that searches for evidence of racial discrimination, bias, or disparities in terms of individuals stopped by the police and what charges they faced as a result. It ended up focusing on a relatively narrow dataset, using pandas to explore and analyze specifically traffic stop data collected by the San Diego Police Department as part of the Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015. \n"
